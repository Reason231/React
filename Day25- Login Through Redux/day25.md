a## Things that we have learned in the 5th August as day 25 of React


## Note
- Today we are going to learn the login through the redux instead of useContext
- I have just clone the sir code today so, the design is going to be different.
- Try to login 

## Steps
1. Router.config.file
2. Note=> We can't make the async in redux, so we have use the packages or write some own code.
3. Auth.reducer.file
4. Login.page.tsx file
5. New file=> Auth.api.ts file under the register folder.
6. Store.config.tsx file.
7. Home-header.tsx file
