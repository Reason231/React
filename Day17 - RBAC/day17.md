## Things that we have learned in the 26th July as day 17 of React
- RBAC in react


## Steps
1. RBAC Concept

- For eg-> yedi account seller ko role ma cha vane, usle from the url localhost/admin garera admin ko panel ma access garna napauni

2. Implementing the RBAC
- Go the auth.context.tsx file
- Write the getLoggedIn function
- Write the code in the return of the auth.context.tsx file
- After that go in the http.service.tsx file  in order to get the token
- Then we again write the code in the auth.context.tsx

3. Creating the permission-config.tsx file in the config folder
- Create the permission.config.tsx file.
- After that define the allowUser function.
- After that make these changes in the router.config.tsx file
  <!-- <Route path="/admin" element={<AllowUser allowUser="admin">  
          <AdminPageLayout />
        </AllowUser>}> -->
- Then go to the permission.config.tsx file and write the code


4. Making the permission for the seller panel
- Go the router.config.file
- Copy the code of admin and paste and make it for the seller.
- That's it if you login with seller role, then u can't access the login panel

5. Design the no-permission page
- Create no-permission.page.tsx file in the errrors folder.
- Copy the code of not-found-page file
- Paste it in the no-permission-page file.
- Import the file to the permission.config.tsx file
